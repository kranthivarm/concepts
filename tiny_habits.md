### **Question 1: Most interesting story or idea**

The most interesting idea for me was **how tiny habits remove the pressure of motivation**.
BJ Fogg explains that people fail not because they are lazy, but because the habit is too big. 
The story where people start with **just flossing one tooth** really stood out. 
It felt almost funny at first, but the logic was powerful: once the habit is *tiny and achievable*, consistency becomes automatic. 
This idea completely changes the way we think about discipline.


### **Question 2: How B = MAP makes habits easier**

The formula **B = MAP** means:

- **B – Behavior**: The habit or action you want to perform  
- **M – Motivation**: How much you *want* to do the habit  
- **A – Ability**: How *easy* the habit is to do  
- **P – Prompt**: The trigger or reminder to do the habit  

To make new habits easier, instead of forcing motivation, we should:
- Increase **Ability** by making the habit tiny and simple
- Use a clear **Prompt** that fits naturally into daily life



### **Question 3: Why “Shine” (Celebrate) is important**

Celebration is important because **emotion wires habits into the brain**.  
When we celebrate immediately after completing a habit, the brain releases positive feelings, which strengthens the neural pathway.

Key idea:
> *Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.*

Celebration doesn’t have to be big. It can be:
- Saying “Yes!”
- Smiling
- A small fist pump

This creates **internal motivation**, making the habit stick naturally over time.


### **Question 4: Most interesting story or idea**

The most interesting idea was the concept that **small improvements compound over time**. 
Improving just 1% every day seems insignificant, but over months and years it leads to massive growth. 
The video showed how success is not about overnight transformation, but about **showing up consistently**, even when progress feels invisible.


### **Question 5: Book’s perspective on Identity**

The book emphasizes **identity-based habits**.  
Instead of focusing on *what you want to achieve*, focus on *who you want to become*.


Habits are votes for your identity. Every small action reinforces the type of person you believe you are.



### **Question 6: How to make a habit easier to do**

The book suggests:
- Make the habit **obvious**
- Make it **attractive**
- Make it **easy**
- Make it **satisfying**

Practical strategies:
- Reduce friction (prepare tools in advance)
- Start with the smallest possible version
- Design your environment to support the habit



### **Question 7: How to make a habit harder to do**

To break bad habits:
- Make the cue **invisible**
- Make the habit **unattractive**
- Make it **difficult**
- Make it **unsatisfying**

Examples:
- Delete distracting apps
- Add extra steps or effort
- Use accountability or penalties

The goal is to increase friction so the habit becomes inconvenient.

### **Question 8: One habit I want to do more of**

**Habit:** Daily coding practice  

Steps to make it easier:
- **Cue obvious**: Open laptop immediately after dinner
- **Make it attractive**: Work on interesting mini-projects
- **Make it easy**: Start with just 10 minutes
- **Make it satisfying**: Track streaks and celebrate completion


### **Question 9: One habit I want to eliminate**

**Habit:** Excessive social media scrolling  

Steps to reduce it:
- **Cue invisible**: Remove apps from home screen
- **Make it unattractive**: Turn phone display to grayscale
- **Make it hard**: Log out after every use
- **Make it unsatisfying**: Track wasted time daily
