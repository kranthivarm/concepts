# Learning Process

## 1. Feynman Technique

**Question 1: What is the Feynman Technique? (1 line)**  
The Feynman Technique is a learning method where you understand a concept deeply by explaining it in simple words as if teaching it to a beginner.



## 2. Learning How to Learn – Barbara Oakley (TED Talk)

**Question 2: Most interesting story or idea**  
The idea that the brain switches between two modes of thinking—focused and diffused—and that stepping away from a problem actually helps solve it was the most interesting.

**Question 3: Active and Diffused Modes of Thinking**  
- **Focused (Active) Mode:** Concentrated, analytical thinking used when solving problems directly.  
- **Diffused Mode:** Relaxed thinking that helps form connections and see the bigger picture, often activated during rest.
