## 1. What is the Feynman Technique?
For me, the Feynman Technique means learning something so well that I can explain it in very simple language. If I can’t explain it clearly, it shows that my understanding isn’t complete yet, and I need to go back and relearn it.

## 2. Learning How to Learn – Barbara Oakley (TED Talk)

### Most Interesting Idea
The most interesting thing I learned was that struggling with a problem for a long time isn’t always the best way to solve it. The brain works in two modes, and sometimes taking a break or doing something else actually helps the solution click naturally.

### Focused and Diffused Modes of Thinking

- **Focused Mode:**  
  This is when I sit down, concentrate fully, and try to solve a problem logically. I use this mode while studying, coding, or practicing questions.

- **Diffused Mode:**  
  This mode works in the background. It helps me connect ideas when I’m relaxed—like when walking, resting, or doing something casual.
