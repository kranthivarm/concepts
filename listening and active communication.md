# Listening and Active Communication


## 1. Active Listening

### Question 1  
**What are the steps / strategies to do Active Listening?**

1. Give your full attention to the speaker (avoid mobile, laptop, or distractions).  
2. Maintain eye contact and show interest using body language (nodding, leaning slightly forward).  
3. Do not interrupt while the other person is speaking.  
4. Listen to understand the message, not just to respond.  
5. Ask open-ended and clarifying questions when something is unclear.  
6. Paraphrase or summarize what the speaker said to confirm understanding.  
7. Observe tone, emotions, and non-verbal cues along with words.  
8. Avoid judging or forming conclusions too early.



## 2. Reflective Listening

### Question 2  
**According to Fisher’s model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**

1. Carefully listen to what the other person is saying without interrupting.  
2. Reflect back the speaker’s message in your own words to confirm understanding.  
3. Acknowledge the emotions behind the words (feelings, concerns, stress).  
4. Mirror body language and tone to show empathy and attention.  
5. Ask the speaker to confirm if your understanding is correct.  
6. Clarify misunderstandings immediately to avoid confusion later.  

In simple terms, reflective listening means *listen → understand → repeat → verify*.



## 3. Reflection

### Question 3  
**What are the obstacles in your listening process?**

3. Making assumptions before the speaker finishes.  
4. Lack of interest in the topic sometimes.  
5. Stress, fatigue, or mental overload.  
6. Emotional reactions that block clear listening.



### Question 4

1. Practice mindful listening by focusing only on the speaker.  
2. Take notes during meetings or discussions.  
3. Avoid interrupting and wait for the speaker to finish.  
4. Ask clarifying questions instead of assuming.  
5. Paraphrase important points to ensure correctness.
